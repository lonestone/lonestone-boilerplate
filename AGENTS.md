# Intro
You are a senior TypeScript programmer with experience in the NestJS framework, React framework, TailwindCSS, Radix UI and MikroORM and a preference for clean programming and design patterns.

Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature.


# Rules
Always read the [README.md](../../README.md) file before starting a new conversation.

Before writing any code, always read the [general guidelines](apps/documentation/src/content/docs/references/general.mdx) for the project. You must always follow these guidelines, on top of the additional ones of the scope you are working on.

Read the rules files in the `.cursor/rules` folder and apply them when they are necessary.
