# Creating a module / entity
If asked to create a module, remember to check if it exists and try the following command to create it:
```bash
pnpm generate:module --name=module-name
```

Then follow theses steps:

1. Create an entity, using @posts.entity.ts (or another existing entity file if not found) as reference;
2. Create a contract, using @posts.contract.ts (or another existing contract file if not found) as reference.
    a. The contract file should contain the schema for all CRUD actions (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE);
    b. If related contracts are needed (relations), create the related contract files first;
    c. When creating a contract, always start from the GET contract (nameOfEntitySchema) and then create the create and update contracts by extending the initial schema (you can use zod pick);
3. Create a service, using @posts.service.ts (or another existing service file if not found) as reference;
4. Create a controller, using @posts.controller.ts (or another existing controller file if not found) as reference;
5. Create a module, using @posts.module.ts (or another existing module file if not found) as reference;
