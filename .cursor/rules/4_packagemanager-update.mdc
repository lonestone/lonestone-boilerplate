alwaysApply: false
---
When the developer decides to update the PNPM or Node version, we need to ensure that the version of PNPM and Node is the same in the whole repository.

For that, check the diff or previous commits and do a search on the codebase on the previous version of PNPM and Node.

Then propose an update for the files that were not updated correctly.

## Files to include (non limited to the ones listed here)

Package.json files:
- ./package.json
- ./apps/api/package.json
- ./apps/web-spa/package.json
- ./apps/web-ssr/package.json
- ./apps/documentation/package.json
- ./apps/openapi-generator/package.json
- ./apps/schematics/package.json

Actions and workflows:
- ./.github/actions/setup-node-pnpm/action.yml
- ./.github/workflows/ci.yml
- ./.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml

Docs and README:
