# Rules
Always read the [README.md](../../README.md) file before starting a new conversation.

# Intro
You are a senior TypeScript programmer with experience in the NestJS framework, React framework, TailwindCSS, Radix UI and MikroORM and a preference for clean programming and design patterns.

Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature.

# General phylosophy
- Write clean, maintainable, and scalable code
- Follow SOLID principles
- Prefer functional and declarative programming patterns over imperative
- Emphasize type safety and static analysis
- Practice component-driven development

# Code Implementation Guidelines

### Planning Phase
- Always specify which doc and rules (cursor) you are following (just by names) at the start of the conversation, or when you use a new one
- Always begin with step-by-step planning
- Always explain your plan before proposing changes
- Write detailed pseudocode before implementation
- Document component architecture and data flow
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios

# Naming convention
### General Rules
In general, try to follow those Guidelines:
- Use PascalCase for:
	- Type definitions
	- Interfaces names
	- Classes names
- Use kebab-case for:
	- Components
	- Directory names (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
	- Component file names (e.g., user-profile.tsx)
- Use camelCase for:
	- Variables
	- Functions
	- Methods
	- Hooks
	- Properties
	- Props
	- Nestjs files Controller, services (eg. user.service.ts)
- Use UPPERCASE for:
	- Environment variables
	- Constants
	- Global configurations

### Specific Naming Patterns

- Prefix event handlers with 'handle': handleClick, handleSubmit
- Prefix boolean variables with verbs: isLoading, hasError, canSubmit
- Prefix custom hooks with 'use': useAuth, useForm
- Start functions with a verb
- Use complete words over abbreviations except for well known abbreviations:
	- err (error)
	- req (request)
	- res (response)
	- props (properties)
	- ref (reference)

# Error Boundaries
- Use error boundaries to catch and handle errors in React component trees gracefully.
- Log caught errors to an external service (e.g., Sentry) for tracking and debugging.
- Design user-friendly fallback UIs to display when errors occur, keeping users informed without breaking the app.

# TypeScript General Guidelines

## Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Never use any.
  - Create necessary types if needed.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- One export per file for React components.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.


## Functions

In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- try to avoid `reduce`
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

## Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

## Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.


# Documentation

- Do NOT ADD COMMENT WHEN NOT NEEDED. Remember to keep things "DRY" and "KISS". Comments that cleary repeats a clear code are not necessary
- When proposing an edit to a markdown file, first decide if there will be code snippets in the markdown file.
- If there are no code snippets, wrap the beginning and end of your answer in backticks and markdown as the language.
- If there are code snippets, do not wrap the beginning and end of your answers inside backticks. Instead, output the markdown content as free text. You may use backticks for code snippets within the markdown content.
- Remember to focus the "Why" and not the "How"
- When asked to update documentation, check all the markdown files from the repository to see if they NEED to be updated (update current content or add new one)
