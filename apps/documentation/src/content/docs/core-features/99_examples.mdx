The boilerplate provides a few examples to help you get started. Those are located in clearly separated folders, to help you remove them if not needed.

## API Examples

The API examples are located in the `apps/api/src/modules/example` folder. They are:
- `ai-example`: Example of an AI chat application
- `comments` and `posts`: Example of a comments and posts system, with basic CRUD operations, contracts, etc.

## Web SPA Example

The web-spa examples are located in the `apps/web-spa/features/examples` folder.

They are:
- `ai-chat-page`, available at `http://localhost:5173/ai-chat`: Example of an AI chat application
- `user-posts-page`, available at `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`: Example of a posts system, with basic CRUD operations, contracts, etc.

# 🧹 How to remove

1. Delete `apps/api/src/modules/example`
2. Remove the module import in `apps/api/src/app.module.ts`
3. Delete `apps/web-spa/features/examples`
4. Remove the routes in `apps/web-spa/app/routes.ts`
5. Generate the types and SDKs again by running `pnpm generate`

You should be good to go!
