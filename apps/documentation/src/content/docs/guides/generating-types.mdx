## How to generate types

For the types to be generated, you need to have the OpenAPI schema available. Which means your **API needs to be running without errors**.

You can generate the types by running the following command (at root level):

```bash
pnpm generate
```

This will generate the types in the `packages/openapi-generator/client` folder. Those types are automatically imported by the frontend apps.

:::note
The `dev` command will watch for changes in the OpenAPI schema and regenerate the types automatically.

## Usage in frontend apps


To use the generated API client in a frontend app:

```typescript
import { client } from '@boilerstone/openapi-generator'

client.setConfig({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  // other options...
})
```

```typescript
// Usage example
import { postControllerCreatePost } from '@boilerstone/openapi-generator'

const posts = await postControllerCreatePost()
```

## Requirements

For your types to be generated, you first need to ensure that the OpenAPI schema generated by your backend is correct. 

If your types/zod schemas are never outputed in the OpenAPI schema, then the generator will not be able to generate them!

So some basic rules to follow: 

- Zod schemas without `.meta()` will not be generated.
- Zod schemas which are not used by your controllers (in @TypedBody, @TypedParam, @TypedQuery, @TypedRoute.Get, @TypedRoute.Post, @TypedRoute.Put, @TypedRoute.Delete) **will not be generated**.
- Except if you use the `registerSchema()` method from nzoth/server, which will automatically register all schemas used by your controllers.
- Enum used in a schema, with `z.enum()`, will not be exported as runtime enums by default, despite the option in the generator config. You need to export a schema with `meta`, such as 
```typescript
export const postTypeSchema = z.enum(['text', 'image', 'video']).meta({
  title: 'Post Type',
  description: 'Type of the post',
})`
```
for the enum to be namely exported.

## What to watch out for

- Don't forget to commit your generated types to the repository, as they will be used for production builds.
- If your type do not refresh, check out for API errors in your console. If the API is not running, the types generation can't be done.
