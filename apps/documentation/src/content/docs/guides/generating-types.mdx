## How to generate types

For the types to be generated, you need to have the OpenAPI schema available. Which means your **API needs to be running without errors**.

You can generate the types by running the following command (at root level):

```bash
pnpm generate
```

This will generate the types in the `packages/openapi-generator/client` folder. Those types are automatically imported by the frontend apps.

:::note
The `dev` command will watch for changes in the OpenAPI schema and regenerate the types automatically.

## Usage in frontend apps


To use the generated API client in a frontend app:

```typescript
import { client } from '@boilerstone/openapi-generator'

client.setConfig({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  // other options...
})
```

```typescript
// Usage example
import { postControllerCreatePost } from '@boilerstone/openapi-generator'

const posts = await postControllerCreatePost()
```


## What to watch out for

- Don't forget to commit your generated types to the repository, as they will be used for production builds.
- If your type do not refresh, check out for API errors in your console. If the API is not running, the types generation can't be done.
