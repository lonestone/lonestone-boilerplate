You can use this template on Github and start coding immediately.

Once your project is created, follow thoses steps:

1. Select which provided modules you do not need. Follow the according Explanations page to remove them cleanly
2. Setup your env files
3. Install the dependencies
4. Get coding

We decided to keep the installation / usage documentation close to the code, so check the [project's README.md](https://github.com/lonestone/lonestone-boilerplate/blob/main/README.md) for more details.
