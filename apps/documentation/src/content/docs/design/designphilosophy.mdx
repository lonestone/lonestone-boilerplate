Why we chose some tools, why we chose the "removal" path, etc.

- Removing elements from the repo is easier (for now) that creating a whole bunch of modular packages to combine
- Upgradability is not a priority for us. Once a project is launched, we will not upgrade the dependencies that much (doing it manually is OK)
- We don't have the staff to maintain a lot of packages, sync their versions, etc.


## 🔍 Overview
This project uses a "monorepo" architecture. The advantages are numerous, but primarily:

- Ability to develop full-stack features without context switching, making a single PR for a complete feature;
- Easier deployment: no need to synchronize multiple separate deployments;
- Strong end-to-end typing, easier refactoring;
- Simplified and unified tooling (linter, build, etc.)
