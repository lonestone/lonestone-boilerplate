# Changelog

This document serves as an history of the project, the actions done, and the global milestones if any.

Here is the template for the changelog:

Remember that changelogs should not be redundant with the code changes or tasks files. If a new task is created, a one liner for the task should be enough (and a link to the task file).

Be as concise as possible in this changelog. Do not list modified files for no reason (we have git for that).

```md
## X. YYYY-MM-DD

Summary of the session:
1. Can list done tasks
2. Should list takeways without being redundant with the tasks themselves (modified files, code changes, etc are listed in the task)
3. Can list key decisions made
4. Can list breaking changes


Project management:
- Created **Task xxx**: xxx (Meta)
