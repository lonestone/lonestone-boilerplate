## Monorepo architecture
This project uses a "monorepo" architecture. The advantages are numerous, but primarily:

- Ability to develop full-stack features without context switching, making a single PR for a complete feature
- Easier deployment: no need to synchronize multiple separate deployments
- Strong end-to-end typing, easier refactoring
- Simplified and unified tooling (linter, build, etc.)

:::note 
While this approach could cause problems on really large codebase, with a lot of developers making changes at the same time, it's a good fit for small to medium-sized projects like we handle at Lonestone.

## Full-stack typing

When working on a fullstack project, we found that having compile time error and warnings are a godsend, but this requires a strategy to sync the typings between the backend and the frontend.

After years using GraphQL, we went back to REST (you can find the reasoning in the [Network Architecture page](/lonestone-boilerplate/explanations/4_network-architecture)), but we kept most benefits of GraphQL: full typing, documentation, caching, etc.
