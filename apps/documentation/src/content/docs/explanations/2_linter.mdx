## ❓ How it works
The project uses ESLint for linting the code. It uses ESlint "flat config", and is based on the [Antfu ESLint config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config).

Antfu rules are solid, and this allows us to pretty much ignore the linting rules for the moment, and focus on the code.

:::caution
This eslint config uses eslint stylistic, which means **you dot not need** prettier in your project.

## 📝 How to use

The linting is done automatically when you run `pnpm lint`. You can also run `pnpm lint:fix` to fix the linting errors automatically.

## 🔧 How to customize rules

Flat config allows us to centralize all the rules in a single file, and to override them for specific files or directories.

For example, here is how we disable some rules for the API module:

```js
export default antfu(
  // Previous global rules...
  // Only override rules for the API module
  {
    files: ['apps/api/**/*.ts', 'apps/api/**/*.json'],
    rules: {
      'ts/consistent-type-imports': 'off',
      'node/prefer-global/process': ['error', 'always'],
    },
  }
)
```

Check out the [Antfu ESLint config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config) for more details on the rules and how to override them.

:::caution
Antfu renames some rules for consistency. For example, `ts/no-explicit-any` is renamed to `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`.
So if you want to disable a rule, you need to use the renamed rule name.
