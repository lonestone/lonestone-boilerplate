description: Auth explanation

The authentication system is handled by the [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) library, which provides most features you will ever need, plus some more.

Better-auth is heavily plugin-based, we propose a few guides on how to add some specific features like [organizations](/lonestone-boilerplate/addons/better-auth-orgs), [admin](/lonestone-boilerplate/addons/better-auth-admin), etc.

# ❓ How it works

Better-auth is using your database to store all of its data. Depending on the ORM you use, you might need to create some entities to store the data. 

We use MikroORM in this boilerplate, and you can find the entities in the [auth module](https://github.com/lonestone/lonestone-boilerplate/blob/main/apps/api/src/modules/auth).

:::note
It's a good practise to keep all entities related to better-auth in the auth module!

# 📝 How to use
Better-auth provides server and client methods, see the [Better Auth documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs) for more details.

Better-auth provides a OpenAPI schema and a live documentation of your API endpoints. You can find it at [http://localhost:3000/api/auth/reference](http://localhost:3000/api/auth/reference) by default.

:::note
It's good practice to prefix better-auth related entities table names with `auth_` to keep them organized.

# 🧹 How to remove

:::caution
Removing Better Auth from the project is a bit more work than removing other features. It's not recommended.
:::

1. Delete the `auth` module from the `api/src/modules` folder
2. Remove the AuthModule from the `api/src/app.module.ts` file
3. Remove the `api/src/config/better-auth.config.ts` file
4. Remove the following dependencies from the `api/package.json` file:

```json
"better-auth",
"better-auth-mikro-orm",
```

5. Remove the following dependecies from the frontend apps

```json
"better-auth",
```

6. Remove the following env variables from the `api/.env` file:

```
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
```
