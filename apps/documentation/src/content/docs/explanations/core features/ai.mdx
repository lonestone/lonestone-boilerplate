# ❓ How it works

This brick is heavily opinionated. It combines Langfuse for prompts management (storage, versionning, combining, etc) and Vercel AI SDK for the LLms calls.

## Prompt management - Langfuse

Langfuse uses OpenTelemetry to trace the calls to the LLMs (it plays well with Vercel SDK). You can see how OPT is setup in the [AI service file](../../../../../api/src/modules/ai/ai.service.ts).

Langfuse can be self hosted, and is entirely open source. See [their docs](https://langfuse.com/docs) for more advanced usage.

## LLM calls - Vercel AI SDK

The Vercel SDK allows us to easily call the LLMs, and to use Langfuse for tracing. It is also quite easy to switch from one model to another.

## Orchestration - TBD

The boilerplate does not use any orchestration tool. You can use your own, like Mastra or XState.

# 📝 How to use

- Create the Langfuse project in your Langfuse dashboard
- Setup the necessary env variables (LANGFUSE_API_KEY, LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc) in the `api/.env` file.
- You are good to go!

# 🧹 How to remove

1. Delete the `ai` module from the `api/src/modules` folder
2. Remove the following dependencies from the `api/package.json` file:

```json
"@ai-sdk/openai",
"@opentelemetry/api",
"@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node",
"@opentelemetry/sdk-node",
"ai",
"langfuse",
"langfuse-vercel",
```

3. Remove the following env variables from the `api/.env` file:

```
LANGFUSE_API_KEY=
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```
