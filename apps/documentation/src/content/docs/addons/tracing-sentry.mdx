You should add Sentry to log traces in your project.

At Lonestone, we use [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) to log traces, but this guide is mostly applicable for alternatives such as [Signoz](https://signoz.io/).


<Steps>
1. ### Install and setup the Sentry SDK
   See the [Error Reporting with Sentry](/lonestone-boilerplate/addons/error-reporting-sentry) guide for more details.

2. ### Install the NestJS opentelemetry module and dependencies

    I recommend using the opentelemetry-nestjs package, provided by [Amplication](https://amplication.com), which eases up setting up OTEL in a NestJS project. This package requires the @nestjs/microservices package.

   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   pnpm add @amplication/opentelemetry-nestjs @nestjs/microservices
   ```

   <br/>


3. ### Update the `instrument.ts` file at the root of the API project
   ```typescript   title="src/instrument.ts"
        // Ensure to call this before requiring any other modules!
        Sentry.init({
            // [...] other Sentry config ...

            // Setting this will enable tracing
            // In production with high traffic, you should set this to a lower value.
            tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

            // Setting this option to true will send default PII data to Sentry.
            // For example, automatic IP address collection on events
            sendDefaultPii: true,
        })
   ```

   <br/>

4. ### Setup NestJS opentelemetry
    The Amplication package provides good defaults to log traces to Sentry, and is quite easy to setup.

    ```typescript   title="src/app.module.ts"
        // [...] other imports //
        import { NestjsOpenTelemetryModule } from '@amplication/opentelemetry-nestjs'

        @Module({
        imports: [
            NestjsOpenTelemetryModule.forRoot(),
        ],
    })
    export class AppModule {}
    ```

   <br/>

5. ### Test your setup
    Open Yaak or Postman and make a request to the API. You should see traces in Sentry.

     <br/>

6. ### Add tracing to your code
    By default, OTEL does not capture all your method calls (only guards, controllers, db queries, etc.). 
    
    To get more granular details, you can add tracing to your code by using the `@Traceable()` decorator at the class level. This is highly recommended.
    ```typescript
    @Traceable()
    @Injectable()
    export class UserService {
        constructor(private readonly userRepository: UserRepository) {}
    }
    ```
    ![Sentry traces](../../../assets/sentry_traces_traceable.png)
    
    On the left, the added granularity is visible (we can see the service). With more method calls, this can allow for easier performance analysis.
